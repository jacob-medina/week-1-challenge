# Description
[Click here to visit the live website.](https://jacob-medina.github.io/week-1-challenge/)

This project is a landing page mockup for a hypothetical company called Horiseon Marketing, which helps business market themselves online with powerful techniques.

![Final look of the landing page](/assets/images/live-website.png)

The aim of this project was to refactor some starter code, which did not use semantic HTML elements or efficient CSS selectors. The look of the landing page is exactly the same as it began, but the accesibility has been increased dramatically.

## Usage
A user may click on any of the links on the navigation menu to be brought down to their corresponding section.

## Code Source
The two files that were edited in this project were `index.html` and `style.css`.

These files can be found through the following path (from root):
- `index.html`
- `/assets/css/style.css`

## Credits
Starter code created by edX Boot Camps LLC.
